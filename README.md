# Breast_Cancer_Prediction_FNN
This code demonstrates training a Feedforward Neural Network (FNN) on the breast cancer dataset using PyTorch. The dataset, consisting of numerical features and binary labels, is split into training and validation sets and standardized for consistent scaling. A custom neural network class NeuralNet is defined with fully connected layers, batch normalization, dropout, and a sigmoid output for binary classification. The model is trained over 100 epochs using Binary Cross-Entropy Loss and the Adam optimizer, with early stopping and learning rate scheduling to prevent overfitting. The final model achieves a training accuracy of 99.12% and a validation accuracy of 95.61%.
